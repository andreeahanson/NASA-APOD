## Learning goals

The primary learning goal for this project is getting comfortable with being uncomfortable. I had to build this project in a framework that I've never used before, and finish the project in 5 days. Almost all the parts of this project were challenging because of the minimal level of familiarity with the syntax and the logic of the Vue framework. What I gained from completing this project is the confidence that I can take on any challenge, and conquer it, little by little.
